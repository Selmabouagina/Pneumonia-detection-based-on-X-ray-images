# Pneumonia-detection-based-on-X-ray-images

## Overview
This repository contains a deep learning project aimed at detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The project leverages TensorFlow and Keras for building and training models, including a custom CNN architecture and a fine-tuned pre-trained ResNet152V2 model. The dataset used comprises chest X-ray images labeled as 'Normal' and 'Pneumonia', and the models are trained, evaluated, and fine-tuned to achieve high accuracy in classifying these images. This work exemplifies the application of deep learning in medical imaging, contributing to the field of automated diagnostic tools.

## Models
- Custom CNN Model
